# Hello-World
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am a first-grade French immersion teacher in Baton Rouge who integrates a passion for AI and automation into my educational work. Fluent in English and French, I am currently expanding my linguistic skills by learning Spanish and Mandarin Chinese. I am also an active artist and traveler, dedicated to exploring international cultures and various forms of creative expression.
